# A recipe for an Italian Classic: Spaghetti alla Puttanesca

Step 1: As first course, for two persons, get 

1) 150g / 0.3lbs spaghetti number 11 size (good quality, 100% durum wheat)
2) 2 fresh chillies. For fiery version, one habanero
3) one clove of garlic
4) one can (3/4 to 1lb cans) of peeled tomatoes
5) salted / in oil anchovies
6) capers (optional)
7) 4 table spoons of olive oil
8) A bunch of flat parsley


Step 2) Boil in a tall pan 1.5 to 2 lts of waters, or about 3 to 5 pints (he ratio is always 1 lts for 100 grams or 1 pint for an ounce)

Step 3) while the water is heating up, on a chopping board chop finely the garlic, the chillies (discarding the seeds first), the anchovies (2, more if you like it saltier), the stems of the flat parsley, and the capers.
Reserve the leaves of the flat parsley.

Step 4) Heat up the olive oil in a large frying pan. When hot throw in the chooped ingredients. With a wooden spoon stir them and mash the anchovies. The anchovies will melt quickly. As the chopped ingredients get yellowish, pour in the peeled tomatoes, and mash them with the woden spoon. Then turn down the heat to very low.

Step 5) As the water boil, throw in the spaghetti. Steer gently with the wooden spoon to make sure they do not stick to the bottom or to each other. When they are fully immersed in the boiling water, let them cook for 10 minutes (or as indicated on the pasta box/container)  on full heat.

Step 6) Check the sauce: if it gets too thick add a little cooking water from the pasta. Then take one spaghetti strand and check if it is cooked al dente. Bit the strand in half: if the core is just about visible with a slighlty lighter color, they are ready, as they will finish the cooking in the sauce.

Step 7) Drain the pasta in a colander, putting the colander straight back on the tall pan. That will reserve some cooking water.

Step 8) Add the pasta to the frying pan with the sauce. Mix it so that the spaghetti get completely coated in the sauce. Add some reserved cooking water if they get too sticky.

Step 9) Quickly chop the flat parsley and add it to the pan.

Step 10) Serve the pasta in deep plates and enjoy them. If you like grated cheese on top, see if you can get some hard, salty sheep / goat cheese. Wine wise, a light red wine works best, but frankly, it's up to you.

PS 1: if the spaghetti are challenging for you, the pasta types called penne  or maccheroni are a nice alternative. 

PS 2: For an hotter to scorching version, do not deseed the chillies, do not add the peeled tomatoes, just turn off the fire from the frying pan, and add the reserve cooking water as need to keep the pasta nice and smooth.
